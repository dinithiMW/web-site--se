<h2>Revealing the Secret</h2>

<img src="cv.jpg">

<p>  Quality in business, engineering and manufacturing has a practical interpretation. It also can be defined as the best fitness for the purpose. Quality is a perceptual. Customer may focus on quality of products and service and they compare same to competitors in the marketplace. They expect that the products and services shall be reliable, affordable and sustainable. As a person who possessed experience over twenty years with regard to the electrical engineering industry of Sri Lanka I believe that maintaining quality in business is quite challengeable. But I am convinced that Managing quality is fundamental and without quality there is no survival and growth.
